# PastaQuest - Restaurant Website Project

## Project Overview

PastaQuest is a web project aimed at creating a modern, user-friendly website for a pasta-specialized restaurant. The website will showcase the restaurant’s menu, provide an overview of upcoming events, and feature a simple table reservation system. 

## Objective

### Primary Objective:
- Facilitate the online consultation of the restaurant’s menu and events.
- Provide a simple and efficient table reservation system for users.

### Secondary Objective:
- Improve the online visibility of the restaurant through an engaging web presence.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js for building the user interface.
  - CSS for styling with possible future integration of frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for responsive design.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express.js.
  
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB for storing reservations.

- **Other Technologies**:
  - React Router for navigation between pages.
  - Axios for API calls to fetch and submit data.

## Features

- **Menu Page**: Displays a list of available pasta dishes with photos and descriptions.
- **Events Page**: Lists upcoming events with dates and brief descriptions (e.g., concerts, theme nights, promotions).
- **Reservation System**: Users can reserve a table online by filling out a simple form with details such as name, date, time, number of people, and any special requests.

### Key Pages:
- **Homepage**: Introduces the restaurant and highlights pasta specialties.
- **Menu Page**: A list of pasta dishes with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.
- **Event Page**: A list of upcoming events with clear event details.
- **Reservation Form**: A simple form for users to reserve a table with necessary details.
  
## Future Plan

While the website currently offers basic functionality for menu browsing and table reservations, a **back-office system** will be added in the future. The admin dashboard will allow restaurant managers to:
- **Manage Reservations**: View, update, or delete customer reservations.
- **Update Menu**: Add, modify, or delete dishes on the menu.
- **Event Management**: Add or update details of upcoming events like concerts, theme nights, etc.

This back-office system will be essential for streamlining restaurant management tasks.


## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a seamless user experience for customers of PastaQuest while simplifying restaurant management. The initial phase of the project includes a user-facing website with menu, event, and reservation features. The future phases will include an admin dashboard for content management and reservation handling.
